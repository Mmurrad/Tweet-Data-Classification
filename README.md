# Tweet-Data-Classification
In this project, we classified tweet data into four languages: English, Chinese, Russian, and Arabic. Initially, we trained the dataset for each language separately using various RNN-based models. Afterward, we combined all the datasets and trained them collectively using LLM. The dataset used in this project was self-collected.
